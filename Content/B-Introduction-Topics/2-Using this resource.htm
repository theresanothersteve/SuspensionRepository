        <p>This resource is divided into two main sections.</p>
        <p>The first section is about suspension and attempts to explain concepts in simple language. It is by no means a definitive guide but a first step in learning about suspension. It has done its job if it inspires you to conduct further research.</p>
        <p>The second part explains doing a basic suspension setup. It does not replace an expert setup, but it will help put your motorcycle suspension in a wider window that an expert would set up.</p>
