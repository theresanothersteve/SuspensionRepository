        <p>This resource is divided into two main sections.</p>
        <p>The first section is about suspension and tries to explain concepts in simple language. It is by no means a definitive guide but hopefully a first step in learning about suspension. It has done its job if it inspires you to conduct further research.</p>
        <p>The second part of the resource is about doing a basic suspension setup. It does not replace a setup done by a suspension expert, but it will help put your motorcycle suspension in a narrower window that an expert would set up.</p>
