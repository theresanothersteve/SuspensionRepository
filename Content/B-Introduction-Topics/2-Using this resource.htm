        <p>This resource is divided into 2 main sections.</p>
        <p>The first section is about suspension and tries to explain concepts in simple language. It is by no means a definitive guide but hopefully a first step in learning about suspension. If it inspires you to conduct further research it has more than done its job.</p>
        <p>The second part of the resource is about doing a basic suspension set up. It does not replace a set up done by a suspension expert, but it will help put your motorcycle suspension in a narrower window surrounding that an expert would set up.</p>
