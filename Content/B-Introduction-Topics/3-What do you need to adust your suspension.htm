        <h1>What do you need to adust your suspension?</h1>
        <p>You are going to need some basic tools.</p>
        <p>Do not try and make do, adjusting the preload ring on your rear damper with a hammer and chisel (or just as worse, a screw driver) is going to damage your tools as well as the abused suspension components.</p>
        <p>Buy, beg, or borrow the right tools. For more expensive items, several riders can form a syndicate and buy something between them.</p>
        <h2>Basic tools</h2>
        <p>As a minimum you will need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a spanner to fit the preload adjuster on top of the forks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a screwdriver or Allen key to fit the rebound damping adjuster on top of the forks</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a screwdriver or Allen key to fit the compression damping adjuster at the bottom of the forks (on some bikes compression and rebound damping are on different fork legs at the top)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a C spanner for adjusting the locking and preload rings on the rear damper</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a screwdriver or Allen key to fit the rebound damping adjuster on top of the rear damper; some motorcycles have knobs so you can use your fingers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a screwdriver or Allen key to fit the compression damping adjuster on the bottom of the rear damper; some motorcycles have knobs so you can use your fingers</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a tape measure</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a notepad and pen (or pencil)</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instead of a spanner to adust fork preload you can use a socket. Another useful tool is a tee wrench, with the right size head. If access is tight, you can buy a tee wrench and grind the shaft to get extra clearance. A Tee wrench, or socket set used in the same way, allows you to make full turns without removing the socket head, making counting turns easier.</p>

        </p>
        <p>An Allen key with a ball head is also handy in tight spots. It, too, allows complete turns.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A C spanner of the right size for the adjusting rings will make working on the rear preload much easier. A C spanner with a lug on both ends of the C is more versatile.</p>

        </p>
        <p>A tape measure is used for measuring how much the suspension compresses. A steel ruler or vernier calliper can also be used, particularly on front suspension. It is a good idea to use a measuring device that shows millimetres, it makes calculations a lot simpler.</p>
        <h2>Other tools</h2>
        <p>Other tools, while not essential, make the job easier.</p>
        <p>Tools to consider include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>a wheel chock</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a rear (paddock) stand</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a motorcycle lift</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a sag scale</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>a spreadsheet on a PC, tablet, or smart phone</p>
