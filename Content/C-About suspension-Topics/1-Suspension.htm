        <h1>Suspension</h1>
        <p>Suspension does two things:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>It makes the ride more comfortable for the rider.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It keeps the loaded tyres in contact with the road surface.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's it.</p>
        <p>Modern motorcycle suspension has three things that can be adjusted to help do its job:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Spring preload.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rebound damping.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Compression damping.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Some motorcycles also allow geometry changes that are outside of this guide.</p>
