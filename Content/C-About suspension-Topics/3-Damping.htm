        <h1>Damping</h1>
        <p>Springs store energy by compressing (or extending, depending on the type of spring). When the load is released, the spring unleashes the energy, returning back to its original form. Depending on the amount of energy, it might extend past its stable length and then return. This can happen for multiple cycles, compressing and extending until all the energy is spent through overcoming friction.</p>
        <p>Ideally, motorcycle suspension should not go through several extensions and compressions. This would leave the spring ill equipped for another load and mean the suspension was bouncing up and down.</p>
        <p>Suspension springs, therefore, have damping.</p>
        <p>Damping controls the compression and extension, or rebounding, of the spring by using the energy somewhere else. Excess energy is turned to heat, controlling the speed the spring absorbs the impact and returns to its relaxed form.</p>
        <p>Originally, engineers tried to dampen using rubber blocks, creating friction the spring worked against.</p>
        <p>Modern damping uses hydraulics. Hydraulics use an incompressible liquid inside a chamber. For the spring to work it must push a piston through the cylinder, displacing the fluid. The cylinder has a small orifice, allowing the fluid to be displaced. Forcing the fluid through the orifice creates heat.</p>
        <p>Passing the fluid one way controls compression, the other way controls rebound.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the orifice size can be changed, it will allow more, or less, fluid through, changing the speed it allows the spring to compress or extend.</p>
        <p>This is a simplified explanation. Rather than a simple orifice, motorcycle suspensions use sophisticated shim stacks that deflect, controlling fluid flow.</p>
        <p>Opening a damping adjuster by turning it anticlockwise allows more oil to flow.This is known as making it faster, or softer. Conversely, closing a damping setting by turning it clockwise makes the oil flow slower, or harder.</p>
