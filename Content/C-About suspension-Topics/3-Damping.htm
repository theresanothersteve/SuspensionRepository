        <h1>Damping</h1>
        <p>Springs store energy by compressing (or extending, depending on the spring type). When the load is released, the spring unleashes the energy, returning to its original form. Depending on the amount of energy, it might extend past its stable length and then return. This oscillation can happen for multiple cycles, compressing and extending until all the energy is spent through overcoming friction.</p>
        <p>Ideally, motorcycle suspension should not go through several extensions and compressions. This repeated cycle would leave the spring ill-equipped for another load as the load might occur mid-cycle.</p>
        <p>Suspension springs, therefore, have damping.</p>
        <p>Damping controls the spring’s compression and extension, or travel, by using energy elsewhere. Excess energy is turned to heat, controlling the speed the spring absorbs the impact and returns to its relaxed form.</p>
        <p>Originally, engineers tried to dampen using rubber blocks, creating friction to control the spring’s movement.</p>
        <p>Modern damping uses hydraulics. Hydraulics use an incompressible liquid inside a chamber. For the spring to work, it must push a piston through the cylinder, displacing the fluid. The cylinder has a small orifice, allowing the fluid to be displaced. Forcing the fluid through the orifice creates heat.</p>
        <p>Passing the fluid one way controls compression, and the other way controls rebound.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the orifice size can be changed, it will allow more, or less, fluid through; changing the speed the spring can be compressed or extended.</p>
        <p>This explanation has been simplified. Rather than a simple orifice, motorcycle suspensions use sophisticated shim stacks that deflect, controlling fluid flow.</p>
        <p>Opening a damping adjuster by turning it anticlockwise allows more oil to flow, known as making it faster or softer. Conversely, closing a damping setting by turning it clockwise makes the oil flow slower.</p>
