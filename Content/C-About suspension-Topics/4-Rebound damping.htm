        <h2>Rebound damping</h2>
        <p>Rebound damping is the damping applied to a spring when it rebounds or moves back to its natural state.</p>
        <p>If rebound damping is too restricted, or too slow, the suspension will be too slow extending back to its static height. The wheel will take too long to return to full contact with the road.</p>
        <p>If rebound damping is too fast, it will not control the energy generated by the spring as it returns to its uncompressed length. The suspension might start compressing again, causing a ride like a pogo stick.</p>
        <p>Rebound damping can be likened to a tap. If you wind a tap fully open by turning the handle clockwise until it stops, it will allow a large amount of water to pass. As you turn the tap handle anticlockwise, it allows less water to flow. This can be considered a fast flow (fully open) or slow (as the tap is closed).</p>
        <p>The adjusters for rebound damping (clickers) are precision flow control devices. The clicks allow for fine adjustment by counting the clicks. The mechanical action that makes the clicks also helps prevent the adjusters from moving.</p>
        <p>Rebound adjusters are usually found at the top of the forks or rear shock absorbers.</p>
