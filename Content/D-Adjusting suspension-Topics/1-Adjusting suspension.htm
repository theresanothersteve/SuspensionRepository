        <h1>Adjusting suspension</h1>
        <p>Adjusting suspension is not difficult, particularly if you take your time and have a methodical approach.</p>
        <p>It is a good idea to make a record of changes, and why you make them. A spreadsheet, such as Excel or Google Sheets helps you keep track of the changes. Start by turning each of the damping adjusters clockwise until you feel resistance, counting the clicks. Write down the number of clicks for each adjuster. Return the adjusters to the original settings.</p>
        <p class="Important">Do not over tighten the damping adjusters, when you feel a slight resistance the adjuster has seated. Over tightening can damage the adjuster.</p>
        <p>Next, make a record of the current fork spring preload. Turn the preload adjusters fully anticlockwise (the opposite of what you did with the damping adjusters) and count the number of turns. Do it on both forks. Write down the number of turns preload and write it down. Return the preload to the original setting.</p>

        </p>
        <p>If the rear shock absorber has adjusting rings, measure the distance between the lock ring and somewhere obvious on the shock body, such as a step or ridge, and write it down. If it has a twist adjuster that has progressively higher stops, make a note of the current setting.</p>
        <p>If you want to be thorough, and get a better understanding of your motorcycle, you can also turn the adjusters fully the other way so you know the total number of clicks or turns of preload you have at your disposal.</p>
        <p>If you have bought a second hand motorcycle, it is a good idea to return the suspension to factory settings. Factory settings can be found in the owner's manual. If the bike did not come with a manual, owners forums on the internet or social media pages dedicated to the make and model are frequented by people who like to help fellow riders with the same bike.</p>
        <p>The last step in preparing to adjust your suspension is to set the tyre pressures. If you are unsure, use the pressure from the owner's manual or the website of the brand of tyres you are using. This is optional, but helps create a consistent approach to setting and (more importantly) testing your suspension.</p>
