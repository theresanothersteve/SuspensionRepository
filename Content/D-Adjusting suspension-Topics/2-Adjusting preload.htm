        <h1>Adjusting preload</h1>
        <p>The first step in adjusting suspension is to adjust the preload.</p>
        <p>There are three measurements used in setting preload:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>The suspension when it is fully extended.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The amount the weight of the motorcycle compresses the suspension.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The amount the weight of the rider (added to the compression from the bike on its own) compresses the suspension.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The amount the motorcycle compresses the suspension is the static sag.</p>
        <p>The amount the rider compresses the suspension is the rider sag.</p>
        <p>Static and rider sag combined is the total sag, although it, too, is sometimes called rider sag.</p>
        <p>The total sag should be compared to the total amount of suspension travel, which can be found in the owner's manual, manufacturer's website (for current models), or specifications websites.</p>
        <p>Ideally, sag should be set on a road bike so the total sag is approximately 1/3 (30-35%) of the total suspension travel. For track bikes, it can be reduced to approximately 1/4 (25-35%) of total travel. These settings allow the suspension to absorb bumps through compression and extend down into imperfections or accommodate weight transfer (backwards under acceleration, forward under braking).</p>
        <h2>Adjusting preload on the forks</h2>
        <p>If you are adjusting the suspension for the first time, returning the adjustments to the factory settings is a good place to start. It is also a sensible idea to ensure the tyre pressure is correct, either the factory setting, the tyre manufacturer’s recommendations, or the pressure you usually use.</p>
        <p>Turn all the damping adjusters fully anticlockwise, counting the clicks or number of turns. Write the number down so you can return the damping adjusters to their current position when you have finished.</p>
        <p class="Tip">Protect the preload adjuster by putting a thin, damp cloth over it before adjusting with a socket or spanner. The adjuster is usually made from machined alloy and is easily marred.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Turn the preload adjuster anticlockwise until it stops, counting the turns as you go. It is a good idea to count half turns. Write down the number of turns you made. You can wind the adjuster all the way clockwise if you wish, also counting the number of turns. That will give you an indication of the adjustment range. Take the preload back to its original setting.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>2.	Repeat the process on the other fork leg. You do not need to work out the adjustment range; it should be the same as the first leg you checked. Turn the adjuster the same number of turns clockwise, so it is the same preload as the other leg.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>If you have a stand that lifts the front wheel off the ground, you can use it to help measure the distance between the fork seal and a point on the end of the fork. You will need to use the same point for all other measurements. Record the measurement.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Using millimetres rather than imperial measurements (inches) when setting up suspension is a good idea. It makes calculations much easier.</p>
        <p>If you do not have a stand that lifts the front wheel off the ground, you can lift the handlebars against the side stand while someone else takes the measurement. If you cannot get the wheel off the ground, the suspension should be unloaded enough to take an appropriate measurement.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>Hold the motorcycle so that it is upright. If you have a suitable stand, use it for stability. Measure between the fork seal and the point you used for the first measurement. Write down the measurement.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If you do not have a suitable stand, hold the bike upright without placing any weight on it and get someone else to take the measurement.</p>
        <ol MadCap:continue="true">
            <li>
                <p>Wearing your riding gear, sit on the bike with your feet on the pegs and hands on the handlebars. Try to position yourself as if you are riding. Get someone to measure between the fork seal and reference point from the previous measurements and write it down.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can do the measurements yourself if you have a suitable stand and a sag measuring tool. If not, you will probably need someone to help stabilise the bike (without adding weight) while someone else records the measurement. If someone is helping by taking the measurements, it is a good idea for them to take all the measurements, so they are made consistently.</p>

                        <p>list the extended length</p>

                    <li>
                        <p>subtract the static sag measurement to get static sag</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <p>add static sag and rider sag to get total sag.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>If your rider sag was taken from the free sag and already includes static sag, you do not have to perform the calculation as the rider sag figure you measured is the total sag.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <div>the measurement with the suspension fully extended is 125 mm</div>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Static sag is 125 mm minus 105 mm, equal to 20 millimetres.</p>
            <p>Rider sag is 105 mm minus 90 mm, equal to 15 millimetres.</p>
            <p>The total sag is 125 mm minus 90 mm, equal to 35 millimetres. It can also be calculated by adding 20 mm to 15 mm.</p>

        <p>28 per cent of travel is less than the desired 30-35 per cent for road use; the preload will need adjusting.</p>
        <p>If the current rider sag compared to travel expressed as a percentage is too low, the preload will need to be reduced, or turned anticlockwise.</p>
        <p>If the current rider sag compared to travel expressed as a percentage is too high, the preload will need to be increased, or turned clockwise.</p>

        <h2>Adjusting preload on the rear shock absorber</h2>
        <p>The process of setting rear sag is much the same. Turn all the damping adjusters fully anticlockwise, counting the clicks or number of turns. Write the number down so you can return the damping adjusters to their current position when you have finished.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The total sag in the example is 40 millimetres at the front, and the rear is 38 millimetres, so the bike is slightly higher at the back. The percentages are relatively close at 32 per cent each. These measurements mean a baseline has been established.</p>
        <p class="Important">If you are in the first or last 10 per cent of the adjustment range or cannot get sag within the stated range, you should consult a suspension specialist. You might need a spring with a higher or lower rate to make it safe.</p>
        <h2>Sag measuring tools</h2>
        <p>Sag measuring tools make the job much easier.</p>
        <p>They attach magnetically to the axle and another point. Little hooks with adhesive backs can be used, ensuring the same point is used. A cable extends between the tool and the attachment point. Some tools have a hook on a Velcro strip that can be used for the second point on the forks.</p>
        <p>If the axles are hollow, find a socket that has a snug fit and use that to provide a magnetic surface. If the closest socket you have is still too loose, wrap tape around it to provide a snug fit.</p>
        <p>The bike is raised using a lift or against the side stand, and the tool is set to zero. The bike is allowed to settle on the suspension and held upright, and the tool shows static sag. The tool shows the total sag when the rider assumes a riding position.</p>
        <h2>Stiction</h2>
        <p>If someone is helping by taking measurements, they can make the process more accurate by allowing for stiction.</p>
        <p>Stiction is the friction or resistance from the suspension components.</p>
        <p>Instead of measuring where the bike rests, they can gently lift the suspension and let it rest. They take the first measurement. Then they push down on the suspension and let it return, then take the second measurement. The average of the two measurements is the value used for the measurement.</p>
        <p>Calculate the average by adding the two measurements and dividing the result by 2.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>rider sag after unloading the suspension and letting it settle is 38 mm</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>rider sag after compressing the suspension and letting it return is 34 mm</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>the average is 36 millimetres</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>Knowing the stiction also helps identify if suspension needs servicing.</p>
        <p>In front suspension, stiction should be 10 to 20 millimetres. If it is more than 40 mm, the suspension needs servicing.</p>
        <p>Stiction figures on the rear are much tighter; 2 mm is good, while more than 6 mm indicates it needs attention.</p>
