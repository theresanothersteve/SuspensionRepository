        <h1>Adjusting compression damping</h1>
        <p>It is hard to set compression damping statically.</p>
        <p>If you have no other data, the best thing is to set compression damping halfway between fully closed and fully open.</p>
        <h2>Fork compression damping</h2>

        </p>
        <p>Compression damping might be adjusted by a screw on the bottom of each fork leg, a screw on the top of each fork cap, or on one fork (while rebound is on the other).</p>
        <h2>Shock compression damping</h2>
        <p class="CentreAlign">
            <img src="../Resources/Images/Project/RearDampingAdjusters.jpg" alt="Rear damper with adjusters or clickers used to adjust rebound and compression damping" title="Damping adjustments on a rear damper" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { width: 75%; }" />
        </p>
        <p>Shock compression damping is usually on the big end, or canister end, of the rear damper.</p>
        <p>Compression damping adjusters are usually marked COMP.</p>
        <p>If you have another trusted setting, such as that from the owner’s manual, you can use that as a starting point.</p>
        <p>Write down the settings you decided on.</p>
        <p>Place a zip tie around the right-hand fork leg. When the suspension compresses, it will push the zip tie down. When you stop, you can see how much travel has been used during the ride.</p>
        <p>Öhlins also have a spring retained wiper that looks neater but is more expensive than a zip tie. The zip tie does the same job.</p>
