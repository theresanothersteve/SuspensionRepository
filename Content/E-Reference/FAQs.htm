                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>Is suspension a black art?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>No. Suspension is not a black art.</p>
                <p>Riders can learn what each adjustment does and use it to adjust the suspension to suit their weight and riding styles. Each adjuster follows a set of rules that provides a progressive change to how suspension reacts.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>I don't think I'm a good enough rider to need to adjust my suspension. Should I?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Absolutely.</p>
                <p>Adjusting your suspension will enable you to get the best out of your bike at your current ability level. You will continue to learn, constantly moving your skill level higher.</p>

                <MadCap:dropDownHotspot>The manufacturer set it that way, why should I change it?</MadCap:dropDownHotspot>
            </MadCap:dropDownHead>
            <MadCap:dropDownBody>
                <p>Do you ride under the same conditions as the factory test? Are you the same weight as the factory test rider, and do you have similar riding styles? Did the factory test their settings on the roads you ride?</p>
                <p>Of course not, so adjusting suspension for your weight, riding styles, and where you ride helps make the bike fit you.</p>
